# Privacy Policy for Code Preview Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: November 20, 2025**

## Overview
Code Preview is a Chrome extension that displays code snippets and answers from search results directly on Google search pages. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Information We Store Locally
Code Preview stores minimal user preferences locally on your device using Chrome's storage API:

1. **Extension State**: A boolean value indicating whether the extension is enabled or disabled
2. **Theme Preference**: A boolean value indicating whether you prefer dark or light theme for code highlighting

This data is stored locally on your device only and is never transmitted to any external servers.

### Information We Do Not Collect
- We do not collect any personal information
- We do not track your browsing history
- We do not collect search queries
- We do not store or transmit any user data to external servers
- We do not use cookies or tracking technologies
- We do not share any information with third parties

### Permissions Explanation

**Storage Permission**: Used solely to save your extension preferences (on/off state and theme preference) locally on your device.

**Active Tab Permission**: Used to inject code preview functionality into Google search result pages. This allows the extension to display code snippets under relevant search results.

**Scripting Permission**: Required to run the extension's code on Google search pages to extract and display code previews.

**Host Permissions**: The extension accesses web pages from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and other programming-related sites to fetch code snippets. This is done in real-time when you view search results and no data is stored or transmitted elsewhere.

## Third-Party Services
When you view a search result, the extension may fetch content from the linked website (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub) to display a preview. This request is made directly from your browser to those websites and follows their respective privacy policies.

## Data Security
All data stored by this extension remains on your local device. We implement standard security practices to ensure your preferences are stored safely.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
